# Dockerized Streamlit App

## Prototyping a user interface with Streamlit and docker-compose

Sometimes we need to resolve very quickly a delivery or we have to validate a protopyte.

The objective of this project is to provide an interface that allows to a simple user (who don`t manage conda and Jupyter Notebook) select an xls, process its content and obtain the result needed.

Here we go!

> Note: This is a project based on [this one](https://github.com/martinezalina/streamlit-docker).
> The difference is here I used _docker compose_. Why?... This variant, among other things, allows us to see the results of the code while we are coding without the need to do a ´docker ps´, ´docker stop container id´, ´docker build´, etc. In other words, it saves us _a lot of time_.

### Run the app

The first time the project is used, the following commands should be run:

1. Build container:
   `docker-compose build`

2. Run container:
   `docker-compose up -d`

3. You can now view your Streamlit app in your browser http://localhost:8501

4. Browse to upload the xls file and select the example file located ./example/

5. Download the new file generated width the transform

6. To shut down container:
   `docker-compose down`
